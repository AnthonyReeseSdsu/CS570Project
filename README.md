# CS570Project
This is a basic POSIX based shell which was written as a semester long project for my Operating Systems course. In order to test this code, please change the default linux shell to tcsh using the following commands:


-------------------
chsh
--------------------
/bin/tcsh
---------------------
yourpassword(to confirm)
-------------------------------------

You can check that this worked by typing typing the following command:

------------------------
finger $USER
-----------------------
This should display your info, within the info you should see 'Shell: /bin/tcsh'. Once this is done and you have pulled from the repo, type make and the executable will be name 'p2'. Type p2, then press enter and the shell is ready to run. In order to exit 
the shell, press ctrl+c.
